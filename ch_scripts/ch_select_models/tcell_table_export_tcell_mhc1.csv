Also, one molecule has an interface area that was similar to that seen in the 1G4-HLA-A2/NY-ESO-1 structure [PDB: 2BNR], while the other is similar to that of the C49c50 mutant structure [PDB: 2F53].

Complex II: MHC alpha-chain: F, beta2-m chain: G, epitope chain: H, TCR alpha-chain: K, TCR beta-chain: L. One important difference between the two molecules is that MHC residue Q155, located at the interface between the MHC and the CDR2alpha, adopts two different conformations. In the first molecule (AV-wt1, complex I), it contacts S51 of CDR2alpha, while in the other molecule (AV-wt2, complex II), it points toward T94 of TCRalpha. Also, one molecule has an interface area that was similar to that seen in the 1G4-HLA-A2/NY-ESO-1 structure [PDB: 2BNR], while the other is similar to that of the C49c50 mutant structure [PDB: 2F53].
